TextFieldDatePicker
===================

DatePickerTextField for iPad.
This is just a wrapper around CKCalendarView by Jason Kozemczak, to apply the picker functionality to a UITextField.

To use TextFieldDatePicker just change the class from UITextField to TextFieldDatePicker, and it should automatically display a popover when the field is tapped.
